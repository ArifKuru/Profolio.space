# CvBuilder

A dynamic multi-user CV building platform that allows users to create, manage, and share their professional resumes with unique profile pages.

## 📖 Project Story

This project started as a learning exercise based on the "MVC5 ile Sıfırdan Admin Panelli Dinamik CV Sitesi" course by Murat Yücedağ. The initial breakthrough came when I added `user_id` to all tables to ensure data integrity, which enabled the platform to serve multiple users from a single site. The PDF CV export feature was my own addition to enhance the platform's functionality.

## ✨ Features

- User registration and authentication
- Profile management with custom profile pages (`/username`)
- Experience, education, and skills management
- Workflows and achievements tracking
- Social media links integration
- Contact form for profile visitors
- **PDF CV export** (custom feature)
